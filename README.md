Disclaimer - I am completely self-taught and have basically been throwing this together as I've learned. It's getting better but the code can still be a mess in places.

# Terminal's 'Tech Tools

Originally created as a way to download CSV files generated from [MUL](http://www.masterunitlist.info) data, I decided if I was getting the JSON I might as well display and format it, and this project has expanded from there. I decided to keep working on it as a way to keep myself interested while re-teaching myself how to code after a decade. I never expected it to get this far.

## Development
### Features
- List builder for general Alpha Strike play
- List builder with restrictions and validation for the [Wolfnet 350 format](https://wolfsdragoons.com).
- List validator for the Wolfnet 350 format

### Planned
- Build Tournament list check on top of 350 list validator
- Upgrade to app or PWA for more seamless experience
- Add Formations and SPA support to Alpha Strike list builder
